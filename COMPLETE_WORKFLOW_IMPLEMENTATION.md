# 🔍 LinkOps Workflow Audit: Complete Implementation

## ✅ WORKFLOW: Enter Task into Task Bar → Daily Summary

### 🔹 1. Task Entry
A user types a task in the James input bar (e.g., "Create default StorageClass").

**Payload:** `task_id`, `task_description`, optionally includes `orb`, `rune`, or `data`.

**📤 Sent to:**
```http
POST /api/james/evaluate
```

### 🔹 2. James Breaks It Down
James logs task as:
```json
{
  "agent": "james",
  "task_id": "...",
  "action": "Found matching orbs for task",
  "result": "match_found"
}
```

**James searches:**
- Orbs (`/api/orbs`)
- Runes (linked via `orb_id`)

**Logic path:**
- If task is autonomous, mark it as runnable
- If task needs Whis, sanitize it and queue for AI processing
- **NEW:** Automatic task category detection based on content

### 🔹 3. Evaluation Outcomes

| Condition | UI Outcome | Backend Action |
|-----------|------------|----------------|
| ✅ Match Found in Orbs/Runes | Show "✅ Complete with James" | Show formatted solution |
| ✅ Autonomous Task Detected | Show "🚀 Send to Agent" | Log it as dispatched to agent |
| ❌ No match or unclear | James cleans it, logs for Whis | Queue for training (logs table) |

**NEW: Automatic Category Detection:**
- **Kubernetes/DevOps tasks** → `katie`
- **ML/AI tasks** → `whis`
- **Infrastructure tasks** → `igris`
- **General tasks** → `james`

### 🔹 4. "Complete with James"
User clicks:
```http
POST /api/tasks/complete-with-james
```

James logs:
```json
{ 
  "agent": "james", 
  "action": "Completed task with solution", 
  "result": "solution_path_XYZ" 
}
```

Solution path appears for user to copy/paste.

### 🔹 5. "Send to Agent"
Click triggers:
```http
POST /api/tasks/send-to-agent
Body: { "task_id": "...", "agent": "whis" }
```

Agent logs the task as queued:
```json
{ 
  "agent": "whis", 
  "action": "Received task from James", 
  "result": "queued" 
}
```

### 🔹 6. Post-Action Logging
All task outcomes — whether done by:
- James (manual execution)
- Whis/Katie/Igris (automated)
- Or human copy/paste

→ are logged to:
```http
POST /api/logs
```

✅ These logs:
- Feed back into Whis's Training Queue
- Populate Whis's daily digest

## 🌙 End-of-Day AI Workflow (Whis Night Training)

### 🔸 7. Input Types for Whis

| Type | Sanitized by James? | Requires Approval? |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Task entries | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Solution entries | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Q&A entries | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Image/Text extracted entries | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |

### 🔸 8. Whis Night Training
Triggered via:
```http
POST /api/whis/train-nightly
```

**What it does:**
- Reads all logs from today
- Detects tasks, Q&A, and solution patterns
- Adds flagged Runes to:
  - AI/ML Engineering Best Practices (Whis)
  - or Katie/Igris/James depending on agent
- Flags entries needing approval unless it's a Q&A/solution

### 🔸 9. Orb & Rune Approval Queue
**Backend:**
```http
GET /api/whis/approvals
```

**Frontend:**
- Show pending Runes for review
- User clicks ✅ Approve:
```http
POST /api/whis/approve-rune
```

Whis memory is now updated with verified Runes.

## 🧾 📊 Final Summary

✅ Tasks are entered, sanitized by James
✅ Solutions are shown or tasks auto-routed  
✅ Logs are captured for Whis
✅ Whis trains overnight, breaking down entries
✅ Runes are flagged + sent to approval queue
✅ Final summary is viewable in:
```http
GET /api/whis/digest
```

## 🆕 NEW FEATURES IMPLEMENTED
