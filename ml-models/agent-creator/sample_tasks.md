## 💡 Tips for Better Results

- **Be specific**: Instead of "create a script", say "create a bash script to backup MySQL databases"
- **Include requirements**: Mention specific versions, ports, or configurations
- **Specify the environment**: Mention if it's for development, staging, or production
- **Include error handling**: Ask for proper error handling and logging

## 🎯 Example Workflow

1. **Start simple**: Try a basic task like "create a bash script to list files"
2. **Review the output**: Check the generated code for accuracy
3. **Iterate**: Refine your task description based on the results
4. **Save useful tools**: Keep tools that work well for reuse
5. **Test in safe environment**: Always test generated code in a safe environment first

## ⚠️ Safety Notes

- Generated tools are automatically saved to the server
- Always review code before execution
- Test in isolated environments
- The system includes safety checks for dangerous operations
- Generated tools are categorized by complexity and type
