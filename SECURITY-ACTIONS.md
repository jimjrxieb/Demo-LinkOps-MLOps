- **Direct Impact**: None - Platform doesn't use Chromium directly
- **Indirect Impact**: Minimal - Only development dependencies affected
- **Risk Level**: LOW

### Assessment
- **Direct Impact**: HIGH - james_logic service used vulnerable Pillow 10.1.0
- **Indirect Impact**: Image processing functionality at risk
- **Risk Level**: CRITICAL - Fixed by updating to Pillow 11.2.1

### Actions Taken
- [x] Analyzed codebase for Chromium usage
- [x] Identified indirect dependencies
- [x] Created security monitoring plan

### Actions Taken
- [x] Identified vulnerable Pillow 10.1.0 in james_logic service
- [x] Updated Pillow to secure version 11.2.1
- [x] Verified no other services use vulnerable Pillow versions
- [x] Updated security documentation

### Recommended Actions

## Frontend Security Vulnerabilities

### Current Issues
1. **esbuild <=0.24.2** (moderate)
   - Issue: Development server security
   - Fix: Update vite to 7.0.1+ (breaking change)

2. **vue-template-compiler** (moderate)
   - Issue: Client-side XSS vulnerability
   - Fix: Update vue-tsc to 3.0.1+ (breaking change)

### Action Plan
```bash
# Update frontend dependencies
cd frontend
npm audit fix --force
npm update
```

## Security Monitoring

### Regular Checks
- [ ] Weekly: `npm audit` in frontend
- [ ] Weekly: `pip list` for Python dependencies
- [ ] Monthly: CVE database review
- [ ] Quarterly: Dependency update review

### Automated Security
- [ ] Enable Dependabot alerts
- [ ] Configure security scanning in CI/CD
- [ ] Set up automated vulnerability reporting
